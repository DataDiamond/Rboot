### Libraries
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
library(Quandl)
library(xts)
```

###Using Dygraph
Use OECD stats to plot US healthcare and education costs as a percentage of GDP on the same graph.

Use dygraphs with appropriate labeling.

Get the data in xts format from from Quandl using the Quandl package

Provide a pdf of the html knit.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#import data
edu <- Quandl("OECD/NAAG_USA_TLYCG090GS13S", type = "xts")
health <- Quandl("OECD/NAAG_USA_TLYCG070GS13S", type = "xts")

graph <- cbind(edu, health)

dygraph(graph) %>% 
  dySeries("edu", label = "Education as a % of GDP") %>%
  dySeries("health", label = "Health as a % of GDP") %>%
  dyOptions(stackedGraph = TRUE)
```
