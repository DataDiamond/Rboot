### Is Bradman an outlier?
```{r}
ggplot(data = data ,aes(factor(0),Average)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour='red') + xlab("") + ylab("Average")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = data ,aes(Country,Average)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour='red') + xlab("Country") + ylab("Average")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(Average)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "light pink")  + 
  xlab("Average") + 
  ylab("Count")
```



```{r}
#Conducting a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
#A small p-value indicates a low probability that data is normally distributed
shapiro.test(data$Average)
```

The p-value for the Shapiro-Wilk test for Normality is less than .0000. This indicates that the data is NOT normally distributed.

```{r}
#Using Residual analysis for testing outlier status
lmAverage<-lm(Average ~ Country, data=data) # linear regression model
data$Predictions <- predict(lmAverage, newdata=data)
data$Residuals <- data$Average - data$Predictions
head(data)
```
A linear regression model was created predicting the Average based on Country. Those Average Predictions were stored in the dataset. The residuals were also stored in the dataset.


```{r}
#Test to see if Residuals are normally distributed
shapiro.test(data$Residuals)
```

The p-value of the Shapiro-Wilks test is less than .0000 which suggests the residuals are NOT normally distributed and suggests a trend or pattern.

```{r}
###Using manipulated data for testing/visualizing
noBradman <- filter(data, Batsman != "Bradman, D G")
```

Exluded Brandman from the dataset.

```{r}
shapiro.test(noBradman$Average) #running test without Bradman gives less certainty
```
Running the Shapiro-Wilks test without Bradman results in less certainty, but is still statistically significant for normality.


```{r}
shapiro.test(noBradman$Residuals) #running residual test without Bradman
```

```{r}
ggplot(data,aes(factor(0),Residuals)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour='red') + xlab("") + ylab("Residuals") #plotting residuals
```

```{r}
#Calculating how far Bradman is from "average"
avg_Average<-mean(data$Residuals) #the average of all residuals
data[1,6] - (avg_Average + (3*sd(data$Residuals)))
#the difference between Bradman's residual and 3 deviations above the mean
```


###CONCLUSIONS

Bradman is an outlier. A quick boxplot seems to confirm this fact. Even when
      segmenting out results by country, Bradman appears as an outlier in Australia.
      When Bradman is removed from the sample, it conforms more closely to a normal
      distribution. Even an analysis of the residuals with Country as the explanatory
      variable reveals that Bradman is far removed from any sort of standard 
      deviation of the group.
