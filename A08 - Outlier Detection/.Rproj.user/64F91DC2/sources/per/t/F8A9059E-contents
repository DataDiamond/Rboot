#Creating a boxplot of Average Scores
ggplot(cricket,aes(factor(0),Average)) +

#Creating a boxplot of Average Scores by country

#Creating a histogram of Average Scores

#Conducting a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
#A small p-value indicates a low probability that data is normally distributed
shapiro.test(cricket$Average)

#Using Residual analysis for testing outlier status
lmAverage<-lm(Average ~ Country, data=cricket)
cricket$Predictions <- predict(lmAverage, newdata=cricket)
cricket$Residuals <- cricket$Average - cricket$Predictions
shapiro.test(cricket$Residuals)

###Using manipulated data for testing/visualizing
noBradman <- filter(cricket, Batsman != "Bradman, D G")

shapiro.test(noBradman$Average) #running test without Bradman gives less certainty

shapiro.test(noBradman$Residuals) #running residual test without Bradman

ggplot(cricket,aes(factor(0),Residuals)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour='red') + xlab("") + ylab("Residuals") #plotting residuals

#Calculating how far Bradman is from "average"
avg_Average<-mean(cricket$Residuals) #the average of all residuals
cricket[1,6] - (avg_Average + (3*sd(cricket$Residuals)))
#the difference between Bradman's residual and 3 deviations above the mean

###CONCLUSIONS
print("Bradman is an outlier. A quick boxplot seems to confirm this fact. Even when
      segmenting out results by country, Bradman appears as an outlier in Australia.
      When Bradman is removed from the sample, it conforms more closely to a normal
      distribution. Even an analysis of the residuals with Country as the explanatory
      variable reveals that Bradman is far removed from any sort of standard 
      deviation of the group.")
